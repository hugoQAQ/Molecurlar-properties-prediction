Molecular internal energy prediction by Computer Vision using CNN
## Quick preview
- Autor: Weicheng HE
- Supervisor: Dario Rocca
- Context: For the scientific project at Mines Nancy (one day per week), I conducted research for the Labotorary of Theoretical Physics and Chemistry of Unversity of Lorraine. 
- Topic: molecular properties prediction by Artificial Neural Networks
- Methods: properties prediction by molecular image recognition using computer vision algorithms including MLP(Multi-layer perceptron), CNN(Convolutional Neural Network), GCN(Graph Convolutional Network)
- Programming: Python
- Result: the model can get a test RMSE of around 1, a reduction of 97% compared to the previous research.
